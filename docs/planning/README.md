## üí° Implementation Tips

### Start Small, Iterate Fast
- Don't build everything at once
- Get one feature working end-to-end first
- Add complexity incrementally
- Test with real users early

### Follow the Roadmap
- Each phase builds on the previous
- Don't skip ahead (dependencies matter)
- Week 1-2 foundation is critical
- Can adjust timeline but not order

### Use Claude Code Effectively
- Provide specific prompts from Quick Start Guide
- Reference exact document sections
- Ask for one feature at a time
- Review generated code carefully

### Avoid Common Pitfalls
- ‚ùå Don't over-engineer early on
- ‚ùå Don't build payment system in MVP
- ‚ùå Don't try to support every company day 1
- ‚ùå Don't skip authentication/security
- ‚úÖ Do focus on core user value
- ‚úÖ Do implement monitoring early
- ‚úÖ Do gather user feedback continuously
