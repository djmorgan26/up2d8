# Scheduled Digest System - Implementation Complete âœ…

**Date**: October 24, 2025
**Status**: Production-Ready
**Phase**: Backend MVP - Week 5-6 Complete

---

## Summary

We have successfully implemented a fully automated, production-ready scheduled digest system that:
- Sends personalized email digests to users at their preferred time
- Runs automatically every hour via Celery Beat
- Includes proper health checks and monitoring
- Handles timezone-aware delivery
- Uses Gmail SMTP for email delivery

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **Celery Worker & Beat Containers** âœ…

#### Worker Container (`up2d8-worker`)
- **Purpose**: Processes background tasks (scraping, AI summarization, digest generation, email sending)
- **Concurrency**: 4 workers
- **Time Limits**: 15min hard limit, 13min soft limit
- **Max Tasks**: 1000 per child process (prevents memory leaks)
- **Health Check**: Uses `celery inspect ping` every 30s
- **Restart Policy**: `unless-stopped` (auto-restarts on failure)
- **Status**: âœ… HEALTHY

#### Beat Container (`up2d8-beat`)
- **Purpose**: Scheduler that triggers tasks every hour
- **Schedule**: Runs `generate_scheduled_digests` at :00 of every hour
- **Health Check**: Verifies PID file exists every 30s
- **Restart Policy**: `unless-stopped`
- **Persistent Schedule**: Stored in Docker volume `beat_schedule`
- **Status**: âœ… HEALTHY

### 2. **User Preferences API** âœ…

**Files Created**:
- `backend/api/models/preference.py` - Pydantic models for validation
- `backend/api/routers/preferences.py` - REST API endpoints

**Endpoints**:
```
GET  /api/v1/preferences/me              - Get user preferences
PUT  /api/v1/preferences/me              - Update preferences
POST /api/v1/preferences/me/companies/{company}  - Subscribe to company
DELETE /api/v1/preferences/me/companies/{company} - Unsubscribe
```

**Preferences Include**:
- `delivery_time`: Time of day (HH:MM format)
- `timezone`: User's timezone (e.g., "America/New_York", "UTC")
- `delivery_days`: Which days to receive digests (1=Mon, 7=Sun)
- `digest_frequency`: daily, twice_daily, hourly, realtime
- `subscribed_companies`: List of companies to follow
- `subscribed_industries`: List of industries to follow
- `article_count_per_digest`: Number of articles (1-20)
- `summary_style`: micro, standard, detailed

### 3. **Scheduled Digest Task** âœ…

**File**: `backend/workers/tasks/digests.py`

**Tasks**:
1. **`generate_scheduled_digests`** - Runs every hour
   - Finds all active users with daily digest preference
   - Converts each user's delivery time to UTC
   - Queues individual digest tasks for users scheduled at current hour

2. **`generate_user_digest`** - Generates digest for one user
   - Builds personalized digest based on user preferences
   - Sends email via SMTP
   - Handles errors and retries (max 2 retries)

3. **`send_test_digest`** - Manual testing
   - Sends a test digest to any email address
   - Used for verification

**Timezone Logic**:
- Users set delivery time in their local timezone
- Task converts to UTC for comparison
- Respects delivery_days (won't send on user's off days)

### 4. **Digest Builder Service** âœ…

**File**: `backend/api/services/digest_builder.py`

**Features**:
- Selects articles from last 24 hours
- Filters by user's subscribed companies/industries
- Falls back to high-authority sources if no personalized matches
- Marks digest as "personalized" when filters are applied
- Limits to user's preferred article count

**Personalization**:
```python
# If user subscribes to ["OpenAI", "Anthropic", "Google"]
# Only articles mentioning these companies are included
# Uses PostgreSQL array overlap operator (&&)
```

### 5. **Email Digest Template** âœ…

**File**: `backend/api/templates/email_digest.html`

**Design**:
- Beautiful gradient header (purple/blue)
- Responsive layout (mobile + desktop)
- Article cards with:
  - Source name
  - Title
  - AI-generated summary
  - Company/industry tags
  - "Read Full Article" button
- Personalization badge when filters applied
- Footer with preferences management links

### 6. **Docker Configuration** âœ…

**Improvements Made**:
- Added health checks for worker and beat
- Configured graceful shutdown handling
- Set time limits to prevent runaway tasks
- Added restart policies
- Created persistent volume for beat schedule
- Optimized logging levels

**Health Checks**:
```yaml
# Worker Health Check
test: celery -A workers.celery_app inspect ping
interval: 30s
retries: 3
start_period: 40s

# Beat Health Check
test: test -f /tmp/celerybeat.pid
interval: 30s
retries: 3
start_period: 30s
```

## How It Works

### Automatic Digest Flow

```
Every hour at :00 (e.g., 08:00, 09:00, 10:00):

1. Celery Beat triggers â†’ generate_scheduled_digests task

2. Task queries database:
   - Find all active users
   - Filter by digest_frequency = "daily"
   - Get their delivery_time and timezone

3. For each user:
   - Convert current UTC time to user's timezone
   - Check if current hour matches delivery_time.hour
   - Check if today is in delivery_days
   - If YES â†’ Queue generate_user_digest task

4. Worker processes generate_user_digest:
   - Query articles from last 24 hours
   - Apply personalization filters (companies, industries)
   - Limit to user's article_count preference
   - Render HTML email template
   - Send via Gmail SMTP
   - Log success/failure

5. User receives email at their preferred time! ðŸ“§
```

### Example

**User Profile**:
- Email: davidjmorgan26@gmail.com
- Timezone: America/New_York (EST/EDT)
- Delivery Time: 08:00
- Subscribed Companies: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google

**What Happens**:
- At 13:00 UTC (08:00 EST), Celery Beat runs
- Task detects user wants 08:00 EST delivery
- Builds digest with OpenAI/Anthropic/Google articles
- Sends email via SMTP
- User gets email at 8 AM their time âœ…

## Testing & Verification

### Test User Created
- **Email**: davidjmorgan26@gmail.com
- **Password**: password12345
- **Status**: Active
- **Preferences**: Set to receive daily digest

### Manual Tests Performed
1. âœ… Created user account via API
2. âœ… Updated preferences via API
3. âœ… Manually triggered scheduled digest task
4. âœ… Verified email sent via SMTP
5. âœ… Confirmed 10 articles in digest
6. âœ… Verified health checks working
7. âœ… Confirmed Celery Beat auto-triggering hourly

### Test Commands

```bash
# Check all container status
docker-compose ps

# Test scheduled digest manually
docker-compose exec worker python3 -c "
from workers.tasks.digests import generate_scheduled_digests
result = generate_scheduled_digests.apply_async()
print(result.get(timeout=60))
"

# Check beat logs for auto-triggers
docker-compose logs beat | grep "Scheduler: Sending"

# Check worker logs for digest emails
docker-compose logs worker | grep "digest_sent"

# View your preferences
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:8000/api/v1/preferences/me
```

## Production Configuration

### Current Settings (Development)

```yaml
# Email Provider
EMAIL_PROVIDER: smtp
SMTP_HOST: smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT: 587
SMTP_USERNAME: davidjmorgan26@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD: crjd iqod azxs mhyh (Gmail app password)

# Worker Settings
Concurrency: 4 workers
Time Limit: 900s (15 minutes)
Soft Time Limit: 780s (13 minutes)
Max Tasks Per Child: 1000

# Beat Schedule
Digest Generation: Every hour on the hour
Article Scraping: Every 2 hours (high priority sources)
Article Processing: Every 15 minutes
```

### For Production Deployment

**Recommended Changes**:
1. **Email Provider**: Switch to AWS SES or Mailgun for better deliverability
2. **Worker Concurrency**: Scale to 8-16 workers based on load
3. **Monitoring**: Add Sentry for error tracking
4. **Logging**: Ship logs to CloudWatch or Datadog
5. **Secrets**: Use environment variables or AWS Secrets Manager
6. **Database**: Use AWS RDS instead of local PostgreSQL
7. **Redis**: Use AWS ElastiCache instead of local Redis
8. **Multiple Workers**: Deploy worker pool across multiple containers/instances

## How to Start the System

```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Check status
docker-compose ps

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f worker
docker-compose logs -f beat

# Stop all services
docker-compose down
```

**Note**: Celery Beat will automatically trigger digest generation every hour while Docker is running. Users will receive emails at their configured delivery time.
