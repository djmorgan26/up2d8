                    In its latest quarterly earnings report, Intel added $20 billion to its balance sheet, but failed to offer significant details about the progress of its struggling foundry business. This lack of transparency has raised concerns among investors and analysts, who are eager for clarity on the company&#39;s plans to revitalize its manufacturing arm. While Intel did not provide specific updates on the recovery efforts, the addition of $20 billion to its balance sheet suggests that the company is taking steps to shore up its finances. However, the exact nature and scope of these efforts remain unclear.

                    Two 20-year-old college dropouts, Rudy Arora and Sarthak Dhawan, have created a successful AI-powered note-taking app called Turbo AI. The app has gained immense popularity among students and professionals alike, reaching 5 million users worldwide. This achievement is all the more impressive considering that both founders dropped out of college to pursue their entrepreneurial venture. According to reports, Turbo AI has generated an eight-figure annual recurring revenue (ARR), indicating its significant impact on the market. The app&#39;s success can be attributed to its innovative AI technology and user-friendly interface.
