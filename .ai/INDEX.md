## 🎯 Current Focus

**Phase**: Early Development - Building core news digest and chat features

**Next Steps**:
1. Continue developing UI components
2. Integrate Google Gemini AI for chat functionality
3. Implement news digest aggregation
4. Use `/capture` to document features as they're built

**Active Work**: Setting up frontend application with React 19 and design system

### Features (0)
*No features documented yet. Use `/capture` after building features to document them.*

### Components (0)
*No components documented yet. Components will be captured as you build.*

### Patterns (0)
*No patterns documented yet. Patterns will emerge as you build features.*

### Decisions (1)

## 💡 How to Use This Index

**Every session, start here:**

1. **Check Recent Changes** (above) - See what's new since your last session
2. **Review Current Focus** - Understand what we're working on
3. **Use Quick Navigation** - Jump to relevant knowledge
4. **Read GUIDE.md** if you need help finding something specific

**After building something:**

1. Run `/capture` to automatically update this index
2. New knowledge files will be created/updated
3. Recent Changes section will be updated
4. Knowledge counts will increment

**This file is your dashboard** - it tells you everything that's happened and where to find what you need.

## 📈 System Growth

This knowledge base will grow with every feature you build:

- **Week 1**: Foundation + 1-2 features documented
- **Month 1**: 10+ features, emerging patterns documented
- **Month 3**: Comprehensive knowledge base, AI rarely needs to search codebase

**The system learns as you build.**

---

## ⚡ Pro Tips

- **Check this file first** every session to see what's new
- **Run `/capture` regularly** to keep knowledge current
- **Use GUIDE.md** when you don't know where to look
- **Follow existing patterns** once they're documented
- **Update Recent Changes** whenever significant work is done
